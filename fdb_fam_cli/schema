# * Format of rules:

# [a1, a2, a3 ...[b1, b2, b3... [c1, c2, c3...]]]
#
# - The first level (a) defines which attributes are used to name the top level directory
# - The second level (b) defines which attributes are used to name the data files
# - The third level (c) defines which attributes are used as index keys

# * Rules can be grouped

# [a1, a2, a3 ...
#   [b1, b2, b3... [c1, c2, c3...]]
#   [B1, B2, B3... [C1, C2, C3...]]
# ]

# * A list of values can be given for an attribute
# [ ..., stream=enfo/efov, ... ]

# * Attributes can be typed
#   Globally, at the beginning of this file:
#
#   date: Date;
#
#   or in the context of a rule:
#   [type=cl, ... [date:ClimateMonth, ...]]

# * Attributes can be optional
# [ step, levelist?, param ]
# They will be replaced internally by an empty value or a default substitution value: e.g. [domain?g].

# * Attributes can be removed:
# [grid-]
